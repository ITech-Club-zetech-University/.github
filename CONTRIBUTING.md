# Contributing to ITech Community

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
We follow a structured development workflow to keep our projects clean, secure, and maintainable.

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Fork or Clone the Repository
Use the standard GitHub interface to clone or fork the repository you want to work on.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
All changes **must** be done on a branch — never on `main`.

### 3. Make Your Changes
Follow our code style guidelines and write clean, documented code.

### 4. Commit Using Conventional Commits
Examples:
- `feat: add new dashboard view`
- `fix: correct login validation`
- `docs: update installation guide`

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Your PR must include:
- Clear title  
- Description of changes  
- Issue reference (e.g., “Closes #14”)  
- Screenshots (if UI-related)

### 6. PR Review
Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers. Requirements:
- All checks must pass  
- No merge conflicts  
- At least **one approval**

## 🏷 Issue Labels
We use common labels across all repos:

- `good first issue` — beginner-friendly tasks  
- `help wanted` — community support needed  
- `bug` — unintended behavior  
- `enhancement` — improvements or features  

---

## 🧪 Code Quality Requirements

### ✔ Tests (if applicable)  
All major features should include tests.

### ✔ Documentation  
Update README or docs if your change affects usage.

### ✔ Security  
Do not include sensitive data, tokens, or credentials in commits.
